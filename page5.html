<body><p>Erotokritos (Greek: Ἐρωτόκριτος) is a romance composed by
Vikentios (Vitsentzos, "Vincenzo", Vincent) Kornaros in early 17th
century Crete. It consists of 10,012 fifteen-syllable rhymed verses,
the last twelve of which refer to the poet himself. It is written in the
Cretan dialect of the Greek language. Its central theme is love
between Erotokritos (only referred to in the work as Rotokritos or
Rokritos) and Aretousa. Around this theme, revolve other themes
such as honour, friendship, bravery and courage. Erotokritos and
Erophile by Georgios Hortatzis constitute classic examples of
Greek Renaissance literature and are considered to be the most
important works of Cretan literature. It remains a popular work to
this day, largely due to the music that accompanies it when it is
publicly recited. A particular type of rhyming used in the
traditional mantinades was also the one used in Erotokritos</p>

<p>The play takes place in ancient Athens, but the world displayed
is a complex construct which does not correspond to any
particular historical period. Alongside references to classical
Greece there are anachronisms and many elements particular to
Western Europe, such as the jousting competition. The work is
divided in the following five parts:
I. After several years of marriage, a daughter (Aretousa) is born
to the King of Athens (Heracles) and his wife. The son of the
faithful adviser to the king (Erotokritos) falls in love with the
princess. Because he cannot reveal his love, he sings under her
window in the evenings. The girl gradually falls in love with
the unknown singer. Heracles, when he learns about the singer,
organizes an ambush to arrest him, but Erotokritos with his
beloved friend kills the soldiers of the king. Erotokritos,
realising that his love cannot have a happy ending travels to
Chalkida to forget. During his absence, his father falls ill and
when Aretousa visits him, she finds in the room of Erotokritos a
painting of hers and the lyrics he sang. When he returns, he
discovers the absence of his drawing and songs and learns that
the only person that visited them was Aretousa. Realizing that
his identity was revealed and that he may be at risk, he stays at
home pretending to be ill. Aretousa sends him a basket of
apples to wish him well and as an indication she shares his
feelings.
II. The king organizes a jousting competition for the entertainment of his daughter. Many noblemen from
around the known world participate and Erotokritos is the winner.
III. The couple begins to secretly meet under the window of Aretousa. The girl pleads with Erotokritos to
ask her father to allow them to marry. Naturally, the king is angry with the audacity of the young man and
has him exiled. Simultaneously a marriage proposal for Arethusa arrives by the king of Byzantium. The girl
immediately gets engaged secretly to Erotokritos before he leaves the city.
IV. Aretousa refuses to consider any marriage proposals and is imprisoned by the king alongside her
faithful nanny. After three years, when the Vlachs besiege Athens, Erotokritos reappears, his true identity
concealed through magic. In a battle he saves the life of the king and gets wounded in the process.
V. In order to thank the wounded stranger the king offers him his daughter as spouse. Aretousa refuses to
accept this marriage and in discussion with the disguised Erotokritos she persists in her refusal. Erotokritos
submits her to tests to confirm her faith and finally reveals himself after breaking the spell that concealed his
identity. The king accepts the marriage and reconciles with Erotokritos and his father, and Erotokritos
ascends to the throne of Athens.
