<p><strong>An insignificant story</strong></p>

<p>
I wish to talk about a little girl/
A girl that once I knew so well/
She was not big nor she was tall/
She was so tiny, and so small/
When she reached five, she went to school/
Aced all her classes to the full/
But in those times that was not cool/
So, to fit in, she played the fool/
Two boys from class, they used to beat her/
At first her mom could not believe it/
Her daddy said: “Defend yourself”/
She pulled the hair out of their heads/
When she was forced to tutor them/
Because in class they were so lame/
She really pushed them to the edge/
Victory small -but great revenge/
With this and that, they failed the class/
And she got rid of them at last/
</p>
<p>She had a vivid fantasy, lived in a world no -one could see/
When she was asked, “what will you be?”/
Replied: “a Dolphin in the sea”/
She loved the Myths and Tolkien’s Elves/
Unicorns, Fairies, and their Tales/
From empty pages, she made worlds/
Lost in the magic of the words/
After sometime found out she could draw/
Copied from comics like “The Crow”/
She was a senior at the school/
Her favourite book was “Steppenwolf”/
</p>
<p>But still she was not satisfied/
So, in to Art School she applied/
“Maybe this way, I’ll earn a living/
And have the tools to make worlds vivid”/
With black ‘n’ white portraits she went by/
And that was o.k. for a while/
And logos, posters and the likes/
She ‘d stay up sleepless most of nights/
Money was good back in those days/
Should you have skills for such a trade/
She had a rule about the work/
When weekend comes everything stops/
She ‘d go and party with her friends/
Just like tomorrow world would end/
But still she was not satisfied/
Still, could her worlds come more alive?/
Back in those days, poor CGI!!!/
Seemed pointless but she had to try!!!/
</p>

<p>So, different books she went and bought/
With Autodesk guides at the top/
She even studied AutoCAD/
To upgrade the skills, she already had/
3DSMax became her friend/
Maya would even come to aid/
First project was -can’t be forgotten/
Building a gothic house with garden/
Although the thing she really liked/
Was 3D Character Design/
But still, after a while, she was not really satisfied/
Now that she could stage her script/
Let’s have real people acting it/
“What am I missing from my heels?/
Costume Design and Lighting Skills”/
She had an aunt who was a tailor/
She thought “I’ll ask her for a favor”/
“Can you dear aunt see my design/
And bring my fantasy to life?”/
</p>
<p>Then she applied to university/
And found the best teacher she could meet/
Lighting Design for two semesters/
She seeked the knowledge, not the papers/
But even then, after a while, she was not really satisfied/
“Why design fake scenery, thus limiting my fantasy?/
Let’s bring together all my skills/
Let’s try them out, see how that feels”/
She found a course -for movie graphics/
Maybe this was for her to practice/
She was so happy but alas/
The course she found was too advanced/
Advanced Programming was required/
And this fact stopped her from applying/
</p>
<p>Well, time runs quick, and oh! So fast!/
I was that girl back in the past/
If we deserve a second chance/
This is beginning -not the end/
All my achievements -all of my fails/
Have brought me where I stand today/
So, this is what I want to say: /
Thank you for broadening my mind/
For being so giving and so kind/
For all the sweat you shed in class/
Bringing programming to the mass/
For all the excellent work you ‘ve done/
It’s “Hello World” -D. J. Malan!!!/
